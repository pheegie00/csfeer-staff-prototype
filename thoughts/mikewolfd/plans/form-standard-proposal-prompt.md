# Prompt: Design a Modern Declarative Form Standard

> Research prompt for investigating XForms, SHACL, and FHIR R5, then proposing an original JSON-native form definition and validation standard.

---

## The Gap

W3C XForms (2003) remains the most complete declarative form specification ever produced. Its core model — instance data, reactive binds, UI controls — solved the problem of separating form logic from presentation two decades ago. But XForms is trapped in XML. Every modern JSON form library (SurveyJS, JSON Forms, RJSF, Form.io) independently reinvents pieces of XForms without the vocabulary, the completeness, or the coherence.

Nobody has built **"JSON-LD for XForms"** — a format-agnostic, JSON-native standard that carries XForms' declarative power into the modern stack. That's what this should be.

Think of it as: what would XForms look like if it were designed today, for JSON, informed by 20 years of hindsight and the best ideas from SHACL and FHIR R5?

## Investigate

### W3C XForms — the field model

Read the XForms 1.1 spec (https://www.w3.org/TR/xforms11/). Focus on:

- **Model Item Properties (MIPs):** The unified `bind` — calculate, constraint, relevant, required, readonly as expressions per data node
- **The reactive dependency graph** and MIP recomputation semantics
- **Non-relevant data exclusion** — disabled data omitted from submission, not just hidden
- **`xforms:repeat`** — repeatable sections as first-class primitives
- **Multiple instances** — secondary data sources for cross-form references
- **The MVC separation** — instance (data), bind (behavior), UI (presentation) as independent layers

Understand what's essential to the *model* vs what's incidental to XML.

### W3C SHACL — the validation model

Read the SHACL spec (https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/). Focus on:

- **Three severity levels:** Violation, Warning, Info
- **Structured `ValidationResult`:** field path, value, message, constraint component, source shape
- **Constraint composition:** and/or/not/xone
- **The separation of shapes (constraints) from data (instances)**

Understand how SHACL decouples validation *definition* from validation *execution* and *reporting*.

### HL7 FHIR R5 + SDC — the identity and evolution model

Read the FHIR R5 Questionnaire spec (https://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html) and SDC IG (https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/). Focus on:

- **Versioning:** Canonical URL + semver + versionAlgorithm + derivedFrom + status lifecycle
- **Response pinning:** Responses reference a specific definition version
- **Two-tier conditionals:** Simple declarative (enableWhen) vs expression-based (enableWhenExpression)
- **disabledDisplay:** Hidden vs protected distinction for disabled fields
- **Modular composition:** subQuestionnaire + $assemble + assembledFrom
- **Definition/response separation** as distinct resources

Understand how FHIR solves schema evolution without breaking existing data.

### Secondary influences

- **ODK XLSForm** — `${field_name}` expression syntax as a cleaner alternative to XPath
- **SurveyJS** — PEG.js expression engine with dependency tracking and cached evaluation
- **JSON Forms** — Validation modes, external error injection, dual-schema separation
- **CommonGrants** — Bidirectional mapping DSL (field/switch/const) for data transformation between systems

## Requirements It Must Handle

These come from a real federal grant reporting system. They're representative of complex government/financial data collection generally — not domain-specific.

### Field Definitions

- FT-01: Standard types — text, numeric, date, select, multi-select, narrative/long-text, boolean
- FT-02: Financial fields with currency formatting and decimal precision
- FT-03: File attachment fields (the standard models the field; storage is external)
- FT-04: Auto-calculated fields with formula expressions referencing other fields
- FT-05: Pre-populated fields from external data sources, with editable vs locked distinction
- FM-01: Field metadata — human label, description/help text, alternative display labels per context
- FM-02: Default value when field is excluded by conditional logic

### Form Logic

- FL-01: Conditional visibility — fields/sections appear or hide based on other values
- FL-02: Non-relevant data exclusion — hidden fields excluded from submitted data, not just from display
- FL-03: Repeatable sections — dynamically add/remove groups of fields (one-to-many)
- FL-04: Cross-form field dependencies via shared identifiers
- FL-05: Screener/routing logic — direct users to the correct form variant based on answers

### Validation

- VR-01: Three severity levels — error (blocks submission), warning (advisory), info (informational)
- VS-01: Field-level validation (individual field — required, type, min/max, pattern)
- VS-02: Field-group-level validation (related fields together — sum checks, "line items must total")
- VS-03: Form-level validation (cross-section checks — "Section A + Section B = Grand Total")
- VS-04: Cross-form validation (prior-year comparison, identifier consistency across submissions)
- VE-01: Real-time incremental re-evaluation — expression engine supports partial recalculation when a single field changes
- VE-02: Formula-based validation rules using the same expression language as calculated fields
- VE-03: Prior-year comparison rules — flag values that differ significantly from previous submission
- VE-04: Inline explanatory messages tied to specific constraint failures
- VE-05: Saving incomplete sections must never be blocked by validation — validation modes control when rules execute
- VE-06: External validation (e.g., third-party API checks) injected into the same result pipeline as schema-derived errors
- VX-01: Structured validation results — field path, severity, human message, machine-readable code, context data
- VX-02: Results partitioned by severity — `is_valid` considers only errors, not warnings or info
- VX-03: Results consumable by any system (UI, API, PDF, analytics) without importing validation internals

### Versioning & Evolution

- VC-01: Multiple definition versions coexisting simultaneously
- VC-02: Responses pinned to the definition version they were created with
- VC-03: Definitions evolve without breaking existing responses
- VC-04: Form variants derived from a common base (long form / short form)
- VC-05: Year-over-year pre-population from prior responses
- VC-06: Definition lifecycle — draft, active, retired

### Authoring & Extensibility

- AD-01: Schema-driven — definitions are data (JSON), not code
- AD-02: Must support future visual/no-code authoring tools
- AD-03: Program-agnostic — not tied to any specific domain
- AD-04: Extensible for domain-specific field types, validation rules, and expression functions without modifying the core standard

### Explicitly Out of Scope

The standard defines **what fields exist and how values are validated**, not how they're displayed or collected. These are real requirements but belong to other layers — the standard must not prevent them:

- Layout, navigation, progress indication, multi-step wizards
- Rendering (HTML, PDF, API serialization, CSV export)
- Data entry UX (auto-save, collaboration, offline caching, sync)
- Workflow (submission lifecycle, review/approval, transmittal)
- Accessibility and design system compliance (WCAG, USWDS)

## Deliverable

An original standard specification. Not an implementation guide for a specific framework — a **format specification** that could be implemented in any language.

It should:

1. **Define the conceptual model** — the core abstractions (instance, bind, validation shape, form identity, etc.), their relationships, and their semantics. What are the nouns? What are the verbs?

2. **Define the expression language** — syntax, operators, field references (including within repeatable contexts), type coercion rules, and built-in functions. It should be evaluable in any language, not tied to XPath or JavaScript or Python.

3. **Define validation semantics** — how rules execute, how severity partitions results, how validation modes work, how external results merge, how non-relevant fields are handled.

4. **Define versioning semantics** — how definitions are identified, how they evolve, how responses bind to versions, how variants relate to base definitions.

5. **Show the hard cases** — concrete examples in the standard's own format:
   - Budget line items summing to a total that must match a pre-populated award amount
   - Conditional section with dependent required fields and validation
   - Repeatable rows with per-row calculated subtotals and a cross-row total
   - Warning for year-over-year change exceeding a threshold
   - Screener routing to long vs short form variant
   - External validation failure injected alongside schema-derived errors

6. **Document lineage** — what was borrowed from each ancestor (XForms, SHACL, FHIR R5, ODK, etc.), what's original, and why the original parts were necessary.

7. **Define extension points** — where implementors can add domain-specific types, functions, and rules without forking the standard.

Think big. This should read like something that *could* be submitted to a standards body — not as a product spec for one application.
