# AGENTS.md - Project Golden Rules

## About This File

This file contains rules that are injected into every AI coding session. Keep it focused on your "golden rules" - what should ALWAYS be done and what should NEVER be done.

> ⚠️ **Remember**: The longer this file, the less likely AI will follow everything. Be selective and prioritize.

## 🚫 NEVER Do (Hard Rules)

### Security

- Never put API keys, secrets, or credentials in code or version control
- Never use wildcard imports in production code
- Never disable security features without explicit approval
- Never commit sensitive data even in comments

### Code Quality

- Never use global variables
- Never leave debug/print statements in committed code
- Never catch exceptions and ignore them silently
- Never commit code with TODO comments that reference security issues

### Process

- Never commit directly to main/master branch
- Never force push to shared branches
- Never delete tests to make the build pass
- Never skip running the test suite

---

## ✅ ALWAYS Do (Mandatory Practices)

### Before Coding

- Always read existing code in the area you're modifying
- Always check for existing utilities before writing new ones
- Always understand the existing patterns in the codebase

### During Coding

- Always use the project's established patterns and conventions
- Always handle errors explicitly (no silent failures)
- Always use meaningful variable and function names
- Always write self-documenting code (comments for "why", not "what")

### After Coding

- Always run the full test suite before claiming success
- Always verify your changes work as expected
- Always clean up temporary files and debug code
- Always update documentation if behavior changes

---

## 📋 Project-Specific Conventions

### Language/Framework Rules
<!-- Python 3.12+ -->
- Avoid using `# type: ignore` if you must, leave comment as to why
- Prefer `Type | None` over `Optional[Type]`
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Prefer `asyncio.gather` for concurrent operations
- Use `scoped_session[Session]` for web request contexts
- Prefer ORM queries over raw SQL
- Do not use explicit transactions (handled by context generators)
- Use `model_dump()` over `.dict()` for Pydantic models
- Prefer strict validation in Pydantic models
- Use specific exception types, not bare `Exception`
- Log errors before re-raising

### File Organization
<!-- api/checkin_api structure -->
- SQLAlchemy models go in `checkin_api/models/`
- Business logic goes in `checkin_api/services/`
- AI/LLM agents go in `checkin_api/agents/`
- External service clients go in `checkin_api/integrations/`
- Shared utilities go in `checkin_api/utils/`
- Database config and migrations go in `checkin_api/db/`
- Background workers go in `checkin_api/workers/`
- Streamlit UI pages go in `checkin_api/ui/`
- Tests mirror source structure in `tests/` (e.g., `tests/services/`)

### Naming Conventions

- Modules: `snake_case.py` (e.g., `fetch_user_checkins.py`)
- Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `CheckIn`, `UserStatus`)
- Functions/variables: `snake_case` (e.g., `get_user_recent_checkins`)
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `CONVERSATION_CACHE_PREFIX`)
- Test files: `test_*.py` (e.g., `test_conversation_state.py`)
- Test classes: `Test*` (e.g., `TestGetConversationState`)

### Testing Requirements

- Use pytest with class-based test organization
- Use fixtures from `tests/conftest.py` for database sessions and mocks
- Mock external dependencies (Redis, Slack, Google Calendar, AWS SES)
- Use `fakeredis` for Redis testing, `freezegun` for time-dependent tests
- Test classes: `class TestFunctionName:` with methods `def test_behavior:`
- Use `db_scoped_session` fixture for tests requiring database access
- **100% code coverage is required**
- Prefer comprehensive integration tests over small unit tests

## ⚡ Quick Reference

### When You Get Stuck

1. Re-read this file
2. Check existing implementations for patterns
3. Ask for clarification rather than guessing
4. If unsure, implement the simplest solution first

### When Making Changes

1. Small, focused changes
2. One logical change per commit
3. Test before and after
4. Verify nothing else broke

### When Tests Fail

1. Don't disable or delete the test
2. Understand why it's failing
3. Fix the code, not the test (unless test is wrong)
4. Run full suite after fix

---

## Branch Workflow

**Main branch is protected.** All work must be done on feature branches.

### Starting Work on a Task

```bash
# 1. Claim the task in beads
bd update <task-id> --status in_progress

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/<task-id>-short-description

# Examples:
git checkout -b feature/bd-f7a3-integration-tests
git checkout -b feature/issue-42-test-coverage
```

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/<task-id>-description` for features
- `fix/<task-id>-description` for bugs

### Before Any Commits

Always verify you're on the correct branch:

```bash
git branch --show-current  # Should NOT be 'main'
```

## PR Workflow

1. Create feature branch (or use worktree)
2. Make changes and commit
3. Run component-specific tests
4. Run `/describe_pr` to generate description (embeds plan in PR)
5. Create PR: `gh pr create --base main --body-file thoughts/shared/prs/<task-id>_description.md`
6. PRs require review before merge to main
7. After merge: Run `/cleanup <task-id>` to delete plan files

## Document Retention Policy

| Document Type | Location | Retention |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| **ADRs** | `thoughts/shared/adrs/` | **Forever** - architectural decisions |
| **Plans** | `thoughts/shared/plans/` | Delete after PR merges (embedded in PR) |
| **Handoffs** | `thoughts/shared/handoffs/` | Delete after task closes |
| **PR Descriptions** | `thoughts/shared/prs/` | Never commit (local working files) |
| **Research** | `thoughts/shared/research/` | Keep if reusable, delete if one-off |

**Why this works:**

- ADRs document *why* decisions were made - permanent reference value
- Plans document *how* to implement - preserved in PR description, then deletable
- Handoffs bridge sessions - no value after task completion
- PR descriptions are working files - the PR itself is the record


---

## Available Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/create_plan` | Create implementation plan (asks for component) |
| `/implement_plan` | Execute a plan |
| `/iterate_plan` | Update existing plan |
| `/validate_plan` | Verify implementation |
| `/create_adr` | Document architectural decision |
| `/create_handoff` | Save session state |
| `/resume_handoff` | Continue from handoff |
| `/describe_pr` | Generate PR description (embeds plan) |
| `/commit` | Create git commits |
| `/research_codebase` | Document codebase |
| `/create_worktree` | Create parallel worktree |
| `/beads_workflow` | Beads quick reference |

---

## Task Tracking with Beads

This project uses `bd` (beads) for task tracking. At session start:

1. Check for ready work: `bd ready`
2. Pick a task or create one: `bd create "Task title" -t task -p 2`
3. Update status when starting: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
4. Close when done: `bd close <id> --reason "Completed in PR #X"`
5. Sync changes: `bd sync`

## Parallel Development

For complex features, use git worktrees:

1. Create worktree: `/create_worktree` command
2. Each worktree is isolated with its own venv
3. Worktrees share the beads database
4. Use `BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1` in worktrees

## Plans and Handoffs

- Implementation plans: `thoughts/shared/plans/`
- Session handoffs: `thoughts/shared/handoffs/`
- Research docs: `thoughts/shared/research/`

Use `/create_plan` for complex features requiring multiple sessions.
Use `/create_handoff` before ending a session with work in progress.

## PR Workflow

1. Create feature branch (see Branch Workflow above)
2. Make changes and commit to feature branch
3. Run `/describe_pr` to generate PR description
4. Push and create PR:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/<branch-name>
   gh pr create --base main
   ```

5. PRs require review before merge to main

## Agent & Skill Preferences

When exploring or planning, prefer project-specific tools over generic ones:

### For Codebase Exploration

- **Prefer**: `codebase-locator` to find files/components by description
- **Prefer**: `codebase-analyzer` for deep implementation analysis
- **Prefer**: `codebase-pattern-finder` to find examples to model after
- **Avoid**: Generic `Explore` agent unless the above don't fit

### For Research

- **Prefer**: `research_codebase` skill to document findings in `thoughts/`
- **Prefer**: `thoughts-locator` to find existing research/notes

### For Planning

- **Prefer**: `/create_plan` skill (saves to `thoughts/shared/plans/`)
- **Avoid**: `EnterPlanMode` tool (saves to `.claude/plans/`, ephemeral)

### For GIT and finishing work

- **Prefer**: `/commit` and `/describe_pr` skills

### For Implementation

- **Prefer**: `/implement_plan` skill when a plan exists in `thoughts/shared/plans/`

---

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```

5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
